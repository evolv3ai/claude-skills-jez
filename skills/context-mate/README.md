# Context Mate

*"It's all about the context, maaate!"*

Entry point to the Context Mate toolkit - a collection of skills, agents, and commands that work with Claude Code's natural flow.

**The philosophy**: Use what helps, ignore what doesn't. No complex frameworks. No 12-step methodologies. If Homer Simpson can't figure it out in 30 seconds, it's too complicated.

This is the **knifey-spooney approach** to project management - laid back, practical, and doesn't take itself too seriously.
