## Suggesting Icons — Guidelines

1. **Start with universals** — Every site needs nav and contact icons
2. **Add industry specifics** — Pick the most relevant 6-10 from the industry list
3. **Consider the site structure** — What pages will they have? Each page might need its own icon for navigation or feature sections
4. **Don't over-suggest** — 15-25 is the sweet spot. More than 30 icons and the user is overwhelmed, less than 12 and the set feels incomplete
5. **Use clear names** — Name icons by what they depict, not their function. "wrench" not "services". "phone" not "contact-us". This makes them reusable across contexts
6. **Group logically** — Present grouped by category so the user can evaluate coverage area by area
