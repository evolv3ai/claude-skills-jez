### Context Mate

New here? Run `/context-mate` in any project - it scans what you've got and tells you what tools might help:

![Context Mate project analysis](docs/context-mate-analysis.png)

*"It's all about the context, maaate!"*

**The philosophy**: Use what helps, ignore what doesn't. No 47-page methodology guides. No ceremonies. Just tools that help when you need them and stay out of the way when you don't. Homer Simpson could figure this out.

**Full guide**: [skills/context-mate/SKILL.md](skills/context-mate/SKILL.md)

### Where to Start

| You want to... | Run this |
|----------------|----------|
| **Analyze an existing project** | `/context-mate` |
| **Start a brand new project** | `/plan-project` |
| **Resume work from last session** | `/continue-session` |
| **Debug something stubborn** | Use `deep-debug` skill |
| **Just explore** | `/workflow` (interactive guide) |

### Terminology

Three types of things in this toolkit:

| Type | What it is | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Slash Commands** | Typed invocations (`/foo`) | `/context-mate`, `/plan-project` |
| **Skills** | Knowledge bundles Claude loads | `cloudflare-worker-base`, `tailwind-v4-shadcn` |
| **Agents** | Sub-processes for specialized tasks | `commit-helper`, `debugger`, `test-runner` |

**Note**: Slash commands are now part of skills (bundled in `skills/*/commands/`). This is the [official Claude Code pattern](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) - a skill can expose both background knowledge and user-invocable commands.

**Decision tree**:
- "/context-mate" → Slash command (user types it)
- "context-mate" skill → Background knowledge (Claude loads it when relevant)
- `commit-helper` agent → Sub-process (Claude spawns it for heavy tasks)

## How It Works

Claude Code automatically discovers skills in `~/.claude/skills/` and suggests them when relevant:

```
You: "Set up a Cloudflare Worker with D1"
Claude: "Found cloudflare-worker-base and cloudflare-d1 skills. Use them?"
You: "Yes"
→ Production-ready setup, zero errors
```

## Bundled Agents

Some skills include **sub-agents** that can be invoked via the Task tool for specialized tasks:

| Bundle | Agents | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **design** | `a11y-auditor`, `favicon-crafter`, `image-prompter` | Accessibility audits, favicon generation, image prompts |
| **cloudflare** | `cloudflare-deploy`, `cloudflare-debug`, `d1-migration`, `worker-scaffold` | Deployment, debugging, migrations |

**Note**: Agents require manual installation to `~/.claude/agents/`:

```bash
# List available agents
./scripts/install-skill-agents.sh list

# Install agents from a bundle
./scripts/install-skill-agents.sh design
./scripts/install-skill-agents.sh cloudflare

# Install all agents
./scripts/install-skill-agents.sh all

# Restart Claude Code to discover new agents
```

After installation, agents appear in the Task tool's available agents.

## Request a Skill

**Want a skill we don't have?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/jezweb/claude-skills/issues/new?template=skill_request.md&title=Skill+Request:+) with the technology/framework and we'll build it.

Popular requests get prioritized. No need to build it yourself unless you want to.

## Your Own Skills Repo

Want your own skills ecosystem with your own authorship? **Fork this repo** or use it as a template:

1. Fork → customize skills with your preferences
2. Use our QA agents (`content-accuracy-auditor`, `code-example-validator`, `version-checker`) to maintain currency
3. Pull upstream updates when useful

This works well if you maintain skills across multiple machines or want to publish your own collection.

## Creating Skills

**Quick start**:
```bash
cp -r templates/skill-skeleton/ skills/my-skill/
# Edit SKILL.md and README.md
/plugin install ./skills/my-skill  # Test locally
```
