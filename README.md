## Philosophy

**Every skill must produce something.** No knowledge dumps — only workflow recipes that create files, projects, or configurations. Claude's training data handles the rest.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for development details.

## History

This repo started as a collection of 105 skills — many were informational reference guides (CSS patterns, API docs, framework cheatsheets). With Claude Opus 4.6's expanded training data and built-in capabilities, those reference skills became redundant. Claude already knows the material.

**v2** keeps only skills that produce tangible output: files, projects, configurations, deployments. The count dropped from 105 to 23, but each one earns its place.

The full v1 collection is preserved and usable:

```bash
# Browse the v1 skills
git log v1-final -- skills/

# Use a specific v1 skill locally
git checkout v1-final -- skills/css-grid/
claude --plugin-dir ./skills/css-grid

# Or check out the whole v1 collection
git checkout v1-final -- skills/
```

- **Tag `v1-final`** — all 105 skills at the point of transition
- **Branch `archive/low-priority-skills`** — 13 previously archived skills
