# Claude Code Slash Commands

This directory contains **orphan commands** - specialized commands for managing the claude-skills repository itself. These are niche tools not needed by most users.

## ⚠️ Command Reorganization (2026-01-11)

Most slash commands have been moved into their appropriate skills:
