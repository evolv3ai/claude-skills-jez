# This file lives at ~/.admin/.env on EVERY environment (WSL, native, etc.)
# It contains ONLY pointers and context - no secrets, no preferences.
# Secrets belong in $ADMIN_ROOT/.env. Preferences belong in the profile JSON.
#
# Do not edit manually unless migrating to a new ADMIN_ROOT location.

# Where the centralized admin data lives (profiles, logs, registries, etc.)
