# After running migrate-to-vault.sh, this file becomes a MANIFEST:
#   - Non-secret values stay populated (edit freely)
#   - Secret values show empty with "# in vault" comment
#   - load-profile.sh merges this file + vault secrets at runtime
#
# To add a new non-secret key: just add it here
# To add a new secret: add it here (empty), then run secrets --edit
