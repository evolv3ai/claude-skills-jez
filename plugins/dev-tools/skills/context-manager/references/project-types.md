# Project Types

Detect project type from file presence to determine which documentation files are expected. Only suggest docs that match — no enterprise bloat.

## Detection Heuristics

Check indicators in priority order (first match wins for primary type, but types can stack):

| Indicator Files | Project Type |
|----------------|-------------|
| `wrangler.jsonc` or `wrangler.toml` | cloudflare-worker |
| `vite.config.*` + `src/` with `.tsx` files | vite-react |
| `vite.config.*` without React | vite-app |
| `next.config.*` | nextjs |
| `src/index.ts` + `FastMCP` or `McpAgent` imports | mcp-server |
| `skills/` dir + SKILL.md files within | skills-repo |
| `src/routes/` or `src/api/` or `app/api/` | api-project |
| `drizzle.config.*` or `prisma/schema.prisma` or D1 bindings in wrangler | database-project |
| `.claude/agents/` + operational scripts | claude-ops |
| `package.json` only (generic Node) | node-project |
| `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` | python-project |

**Stacking**: A Cloudflare Worker with D1 bindings is both `cloudflare-worker` and `database-project`. Union the expected docs.

## Expected Documentation Per Type

### All projects

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` (root) | Project identity, stack, commands, critical rules |

### cloudflare-worker

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Worker entry point, bindings, routes, middleware |

### vite-react / nextjs

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Component tree, routing, state management, build pipeline |

### mcp-server

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Server structure, tool registration, auth flow |
| `API_ENDPOINTS.md` | Tool catalogue with parameters and return types |

### api-project

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `API_ENDPOINTS.md` | Routes, methods, request/response schemas, auth requirements |
| `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` | Tables, relationships, indexes, migration workflow |

### database-project

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` | Tables, relationships, indexes, migration commands |

### skills-repo

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| Per-skill `SKILL.md` | Each skill directory needs its own SKILL.md |

### claude-ops

No additional docs beyond CLAUDE.md — operational repos are typically self-documenting through their agents and scripts.

## Doc Templates

### ARCHITECTURE.md outline

```markdown
# Architecture

## Overview
[One paragraph: what this project does and how it's structured]

## Stack
[Tech stack with versions]

## Directory Structure
[Tree with purpose annotations]

## Key Flows
[1-3 main data/request flows through the system]

## Deployment
[How to deploy, what happens on deploy]
```

### DATABASE_SCHEMA.md outline

```markdown
# Database Schema

## Tables
[Table per section: name, columns, types, constraints]

## Relationships
[Foreign keys, join patterns]

## Migrations
[How to create/run migrations, local vs remote]

## Indexes
[Non-obvious indexes and why they exist]
```

### API_ENDPOINTS.md outline

```markdown
# API Endpoints

## Authentication
[Auth method, where tokens come from]

## Endpoints
[Per endpoint: method, path, params, response shape, auth required]

## Error Handling
[Standard error format, common error codes]
```

## docs/ Directory

Projects with a `docs/` folder get its contents scanned for staleness and overlap with CLAUDE.md. Common patterns:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Component docs | `docs/RICH_CONTENT_COMPONENTS.md` |
| API guides | `docs/api-guide.md` |
| Planning briefs | `docs/briefs/feature-x.md` |

The audit doesn't manage docs/ content — it flags staleness (broken file references) and overlap (sections duplicated with CLAUDE.md).

## Rules

- Only suggest docs that match detected project type
- Simple projects (node-project, python-project) just need CLAUDE.md
- Don't create empty template docs — only suggest when there's content to fill
- Prefer one well-maintained doc over three sparse ones
- If CLAUDE.md duplicates ARCHITECTURE.md or docs/, move the content to docs/ and keep CLAUDE.md concise
