# Agent DevOps Inventory v1

A minimal, `.env`-style text format that lets agents keep track of:

- Cloud providers (OCI, Hetzner, GCP, Contabo, etc.)
- Local/network providers (home lab, LAN)
- Nodes (remote servers, local PCs, dev boxes, etc.)
- How to connect to each node (local vs SSH)
- Basic metadata (env, role, status, tags)

The goal is to be **painfully simple**: one text file, easy for humans to edit and easy for agents to parse.

## 1. File Naming

Recommended names (but not required):

- `.agent-devops.env`
- `agent-devops.env.local`
- `infra/agent-devops.env`

Any `.env`-style flat `KEY=VALUE` file is acceptable.

---

## 2. General Format

- One entry per line: `KEY=VALUE`
- Lines starting with `#` are comments and must be ignored by agents.
- Blank lines are allowed and must be ignored by agents.
- Keys must use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE**: `A–Z`, `0–9`, `_`.
- Values are arbitrary strings (no quoting rules defined; avoid `=` in values if possible).

Example section separators are purely conventional:

```env
# =========================
# METADATA
# =========================
...
# =========================
# PROVIDERS
# =========================
...
# =========================
# SERVERS / NODES
# =========================
...
